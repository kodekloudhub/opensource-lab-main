# Open Learner Card
This open source repository is under the MIT license. It was started by John Peter, one of the learners at KodeKloud to develop a learner's card for him. 

## Steps to do:
Since he made the project open source, go ahead and set up the card for you.
1 - Change the name on the card from "John Peter" to Your Name. 
2 - Change John's favourite Open source license to your favourite open source license.
